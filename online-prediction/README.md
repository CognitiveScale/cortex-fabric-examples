### Online Prediction Skill

Long running Cortex skill serving REST API prediction requests

Note:
> This project assumes a `fast api server` with one endpoint `/invoke` that is run with the Uvicorn python3 binary; you may change to another framework or language.


#### Files
* `skill.yaml` Skill definition
* `predict/main.py` Python3 code serving the daemon API
* `train/main.py` Example Python3 code for training the model
* `requirements.txt` Python3 libraries dependencies
* `Dockerfile` to build Docker image for this skill

### Steps to Run
1. Update `model.json`, `experiment.json`, `run.json` files in `model` folder. 
2. Make sure `german_credit_model.pickle` file exists in `model` folder. 
If not create one by invoking 

       cd train
       python main.py
       cd ..
       
3. Create Model and Experiment:
            
       ./model/init.sh <PROJECT_NAME> 
        
4. Upload a model file to the cortex experiment from cortex cli before invoking the skill.

       cortex experiments upload-artifact <experiment-name> <run-id> model/german_credit_model.pickle <artifact-name> --project <PROJECT_NAME>
       
5. Publish model:

       cortex models publish <model-name> --project <PROJECT_NAME>

#### Deployment Steps

A Makefile is provided to do these steps. Set environment variables `DOCKER_PREGISTRY_URL` (like <docker-registry-url>/<namespace-org>) and use Makefile to deploy Skill.<br>
* Build and push Docker image, deploy Cortex Action and Skill.
        
        make all 

Follow the below steps for deploying the skill manually.

1. Modify the `requirements.txt` file to provide packages or libraries that the action requires.
2. Build the docker image (uses the `main.py` file)
  
        make build
 
3. Push the docker image to a registry that is connected to your Kubernetes cluster.
  
        make push
  
4. Deploy the action and save skill.
  
        make deploy
  
5. Sample Skill Invocation Input

                ["... < 0 DM", 28, "existing credits paid back duly till now", "car (new)", 4006, "... < 100 DM", "1 <= ... < 4 years", 3, "male : single", "others - none", 2, "car or other, not in attribute 6", "> 25 years", "none", "own", 1, "unskilled - resident", 1, "phone - none", "foreign - yes"]]
          }
        }

* Note: Refer to `train/main.py`  for training example used for this skill.
   
   The Skill is added to the Cortex Fabric catalog and is available for selection when building interventions or Agents.

   Skills that are deployed may be invoked (run) either independently or within an agent.
