# Ames House Price Prediction Example
This example comes from a Kaggle compeition that is designed to help practioners learn advanced regression techniques using Machine Learning.  Using Studio Skill Lab, this example demonstrates how to leverage the tools Cortex 5 provides to help streamline the Data Science Lifecycle across data analysis, data prep/data cleansing, feature engineering, modeling, and deployment.
