Cortex Example : Custom Visual Classification using Cortex

Descrioption:

AI API providers such as Google, Microsoft, IBM have ML Models that are trainable for various domains. These models can then be exposed as APIs that can be consumed by application. This example demonstrates how to train a custom Vision model using IBM Watson Visual Recognition service. A custom skill can then be developed to make it available within Cortex

Pre-requsities:

* Access to Watson APIs using a IBM Cloud Account. 
* A service instance of Watson Visual Recognition (Lite Plan is required)
* A set of images (minimum of 10) for each class or category. Zip file format is required to train Watson Visual Recognition

Setup
* Create a folder called data
* Copy the zip files containing the images for each class into the data folder
